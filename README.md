# Docking Bike Station

This is the Boris Bikes Pair Programming challenge




As a member of the public
So I can return bikes I've hired
I want to dock my bike at the docking station

BIKE ---->
DOCKING STATION ---> dock_bike



As a member of the public
So I can decide whether to use the docking station
I want to see a bike that has been docked


DOCKING STATION ---> has_bike (how many bikes)
